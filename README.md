The documentation can be seen here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/27529981/2s93m1bQp4

The APi is built with express.js with MySQL as the main database. The API is deployed using Cloud Build with App Engine Google Cloud Platform

The cloud build is helped us with the continous development (CD) that connected with this repository and the trigger that provided in cloud build and the app engine helped us with the app deployment/hosting with less cost and simple to deploy. 
All configuration is done with the cloudbuild.yaml and the app.yaml in this repo and also the trigger from cloud build in Google Cloud Platfrom console.
